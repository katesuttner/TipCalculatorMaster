## Notes

I have had a few challenges installing and getting used to working in an integrated development environment. My experience in C++ and unix have transferred with assistance from Google and friends. Object orientation has been a bit of a learning curve for me.
Additionally, I ran into a bit of a wall passing the default value for the tip from the view controller to the settings page. Eventually I was able to establish a segmented index to pass the values.
